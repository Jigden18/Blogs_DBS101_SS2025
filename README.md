Hello, I’m **Jigden Shakya**, and this blog is dedicated to documenting and sharing insights from my lectures on Database Systems Fundamentals. Throughout this blog, I aim to reflect on the key concepts and topics covered in my lectures, providing summaries, explanations, and personal takeaways.

As I progress through my studies, I hope this blog serves as a useful resource for both myself and others who are exploring similar subjects. It’s a place where I can deepen my understanding, clarify any uncertainties, and organize my thoughts on various aspects of units and their applications.

This blog will include detailed discussions of the topics covered in my lectures, with a focus on making complex concepts easier to grasp. I hope it’s useful both for my personal learning and for anyone else looking to explore the subject further.
